# Vulnerability details

**Impact**  
The vulnerability allows users to manipulate the rseth price by directly transferring assets to the deposit pool or node delegator contracts.  
By increasing the `totalAssetAmt` used in the price calculation, users can artificially inflate the rseth price and potentially earn profits from this manipulation.  
**Proof of Concept**  
For example, let's assume the current asset price is denoted as `p`. Now, a user transfers an amount `x` of assets to the deposit pool.  
User's cost for the transferred assets would be `p*x`.  
Before the transfer, the rseth total supply is denoted as `t`, and the price of rseth is represented as `rp`.  
Here is the code rseth price can be inflated.

```solidity
    function getRSETHPrice() external view returns (uint256 rsETHPrice) {
        address rsETHTokenAddress = lrtConfig.rsETH();
        uint256 rsEthSupply = IRSETH(rsETHTokenAddress).totalSupply();

        if (rsEthSupply == 0) {
            return 1 ether;
        }
        // ......
        for (uint16 asset_idx; asset_idx < supportedAssetCount;) {
            address asset = supportedAssets[asset_idx];
            uint256 assetER = getAssetPrice(asset);

---->       uint256 totalAssetAmt = ILRTDepositPool(lrtDepositPoolAddr).getTotalAssetDeposits(asset);
            totalETHInPool += totalAssetAmt * assetER;

            unchecked {
                ++asset_idx;
            }
        }

        return totalETHInPool / rsEthSupply;
    }
```

After the transfer, the new rseth price, denoted as `rsethPrice_new`, can be calculated using the following formula:  
`rsethPrice_new = rp * (1 + (p*x) / t)`  
Here is the code snippet of `getAssetDistributionData` function.  
Both `assetLyingInDepositPool` and `assetLyingInNDCs` can be manipulated.

```solidity
	assetLyingInDepositPool = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 ndcsCount = nodeDelegatorQueue.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < ndcsCount;) {
            assetLyingInNDCs += IERC20(asset).balanceOf(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]);
            assetStakedInEigenLayer += INodeDelegator(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]).getAssetBalance(asset);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```

If the `getRSETHPrice()` function is used as the rseth price oracle, the user can easily manipulate the rseth price by directly transferring assets to the deposit pool.  
By transferring a specific amount of assets, the user can influence the calculation and potentially earn profits from the manipulated rseth price.

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**  
Use custom storage to store the asset balance instead of simple `IERC20.balanceOf`
